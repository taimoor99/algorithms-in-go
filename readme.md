# My study of algorithms and data structures, implemented in go

Hey, this is my repo of all the code I've written when studying algorithms and data structures. I've been using Go for this because it is a fun language that is super easy to compile and use! For now, this includes the following algorithms:

# Sort
- [X] Insertion sort
- [X] Merge sort
- [ ] Quick sort
- [ ] Bubble sort
